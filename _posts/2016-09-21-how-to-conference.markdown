I often struggle to choose which talks to go to when I go to multi-track
software conferences. My old method was to pick based on whether the title and
description matched my interests. But many times that method has led me to
boring talks.

A better way is to choose the best speaker per time slot. Good talks are given
by good speakers. Good speakers are interested in their topic. They couldn't
hide their interest if they tried.

Good talks are also about presentation: does the speaker move through their
content at the right pace? Is the information packed in good chunks with the
right density?  Can they manage their self-awareness loop and waylay cringey
neuroses? Do they balance difficult abstractions with concrete examples? Are
they entertaining?

Here's a process to choose which talks to go to for a given time slot. For each
time slot,

1. Look up all of the speakers on YouTube. Note if they’re not on YouTube.
2. Watch around 5 minutes of their most recent talk. Skip around a little and
   get a feel for how you’d like the talk if you watched it all.
3. Pick the speaker you like best and go to their talk. If you don't like any of
   the speakers, pick one that you couldn’t find on YouTube or plan on getting
   coffee with a colleague.

A few good things will happen if you do this. Your perspective will broaden.
You’ll be more likely to hear a digestable take on an approach or domain that’s
foreign to you. The talk probably won't be boring, even if the content isn’t
that new to you.

I tried this approach at StrangeLoop 2016 and it worked great. I ended up going
to a talk I would’ve never gone to, one about [languages for 3D industrial
knitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02h74L1PmaU). Disney researcher, [Lea
Albaugh](http://instamatique.com/), gave the talk and it was one of the best I
saw at the conference.

Corollary: conference speakers should always strive to improve their speaking
skills. If you're a regular speaker or thinking about starting out, don’t talk
about stuff that doesn't interest you. Study speakers you like and learn from
their flow. Practice and record your talk. Ask yourself: is this a talk that I
would want to go to?
