I go to software conferences and often struggle to pick which talks to go to. My
old method was to pick based on whether the title and description matched my
interests. But this method has led me to mostly boring talks.

A better way is to choose the best speaker per time slot. A good speaker shows
intereset in what they're talking about. They couldn't hide their interest if
they tried. It also has to with the presentation: do they move through their
content at the right pace? Is the information packed in good chunks with the
right density? Have they found a way manage their self-awareness loop and waylay
cringey neuroses? Do they reward taxing abstractions with concrete examples and
humor?

Here's a process to choose which talks to go to for a given time slot. For each
time slot,

1. Look up all of the speakers on YouTube. Note if they’re not on YouTube.
2. Watch around 5 minutes of their most recent talk. Skip around a little and
   get a feel for how you’d like the talk if you watched it all.
3. Pick the speaker you like best and go to their talk. If you don't like any of
   the speakers, pick one that you couldn’t find on Youtube or plan on doing the
   hallway track.

There are a couple of benefits to this approach. Your interests will become more
diverse. You’re more likely to hear a digestable take on an approach or domain
that’s foreign to you. And the more perspectives you collect, the more you can
apply when solving problems. The talk probably won't bore you, even if the
content isn’t that new.

I tried this approach at StrangeLoop 2016 and it worked. I ended up going to a
talk I would’ve never gone to at all, one about languages for 3D industrial
knitting. Disney researcher, Lea Albaugh, gave the talk and it was best talk I
saw at the conference.

Corollary: conference speakers should try to get better at giving talks. Don’t
talk about stuff that doesn't interest you. Study speakers you like and emulate
them. Practice and record your talk. Ask yourself: is this a talk that would
want to go to if I paid hundreds of dollars to go to a conference?
