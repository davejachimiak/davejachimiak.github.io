title: Hi
description: I solve problems with software.
---

I made [A Better Queue](http://abetterqueue.com/), a mashup of Netflix
and Rotten Tomatoes.

I make software at [MUBI](https://mubi.com). I made software at [Iora
Health](http://www.iorahealth.com/).

I'm a musician. I have a master's degree in Studio Music and Jazz
Performance from the University of Miami.
