<h2 class="greeting">Hi, I'm Dave.</h2>
<h3 class="greeting">I solve problems with software.</h3>

I made [A Better Queue](http://abetterqueue.com/), a mashup of Netflix
and Rotten Tomatoes. I make software at [MUBI](https://mubi.com). I made
software at [Iora Health](http://www.iorahealth.com/).

I'm a musician. I have a master's degree in Studio Music and Jazz
Performance from the University of Miami.
